Final Project - Turner Naef

This is a model of Nasa's Perseverance rover. I have implented techniques from the class such as textures,
lighting and tried to follow a standard object oriented based architecture to allow this project to scale.
Alongside the lighting and the textures, I have added a lamp on the camera of the rover that illuminates when
the enviroment turns to night. I have also added a textured offset for the ground so that it appears that the
rover is traversing the martian terrain. Feel free to explore my model in either view mode.

Building:

- run make and then ./final

* My executable is named final and located in the root directory

Usage:
UP/DOWN/RIGHT/LEFT = change view angles for ortho and perspective projections
UP/DOWN/RIGHT/LEFT = move forward, backwards and turn (LEFT/RIGHT) for first person view

W/S = change first person height (first person mode only)

esc key = quit the program

R/r = reset view angles
A/a = show or hide axes

m = change view mode

t = change texture mode

l = toggle lighting

k = toggle light spin
